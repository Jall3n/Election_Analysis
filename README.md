# Election Analysis Challenge

## Overview of Election Audit
The election audit results have been submitted to the election commission, however, they have requested we provide additional data to complete the audit. Utilizing Python and working from a csv we want to use for loops and conditional statements to find the comission's requested results to create a final text file of the results. 
### Additional Data
- Voter turnout for each county
- Percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
- County with the highest turnout
